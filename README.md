# odin-recipes

My First TOP Project after taking a long pause on my learning journey.

In this project, I am maily going to learn how to do proper git commits as well as applying how to use text markups, links, images, and lists.

Recipes used in this project is inspired from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/) website
